    Parameters
    ----------
    gateset : :class:`numpy:numpy.ndarray`
        multidimensional array. The range gates (over which iteration has to
        be performed) are supposed to vary along
        the *last* dimension so, e.g., for a set of `l` radar images stored in
        polar form with `m` azimuths and `n` range-bins the input array's
        shape can be either (l,m,n) or (m,l,n)
        data has to be provided in decibel representation of reflectivity [dBZ]
    a : float
        proportionality factor of the k-Z relation (:math:`k=a \\cdot Z^{b}`).
        Per default set to 1.67e-4.
    b : float
        exponent of the k-Z relation ( :math:`k=a \\cdot Z^{b}` ). Per default
        set to 0.7.
    gate_length : float
        length of a range gate [km]. Per default set to 1.0.
    mode : string
        controls how the function reacts, if the sum of signal and attenuation
        exceeds the threshold ``thrs``
        Possible values:

        - 'warn' : emit a warning through the module's logger but continue
          execution
        - 'zero' : set offending gates to 0.0
        - 'nan' : set offending gates to nan
        - 'except': raise an AttenuationOverflowError exception

        Any other mode will also raise the Exception.
    thrs : float
        threshold, for the sum of attenuation and signal, which is considered
        implausible.

    Returns
    -------
    pia : :class:`numpy:numpy.ndarray
        Array with the same shape as ``gateset`` containing the calculated
        attenuation [dB] for each range gate.

    Raises
    ------
    AttenuationOverflowError
        Exception, if attenuation exceeds ``thrs`` and no handling ``mode`` is
        set.

    Empirical function of frequency and rainfall rate for both standard and
    hydrophobic radomes based on the approach of :cite:`Merceret2000`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gateset : :class:`numpy:numpy.ndarray`
        Multidimensional array, where the range gates (over which
        iteration has to be performed) are supposed to vary along the
        last array-dimension and the azimuths are supposed to vary
        along the next to last array-dimension. Data has to be provided
        in decibel representation of reflectivity [dBZ].
    frequency : float
        Radar-frequency [GHz]:

            Standard frequencies in X-band range between 8.0 and 12.0 GHz,

            Standard frequencies in C-band range between 4.0 and 8.0 GHz,

            Standard frequencies in S-band range between 2.0 and 4.0 GHz.

            Be aware that the empirical fit of the formula was just
            done for C- and S-band. The use for X-band is probably an
            undue extrapolation.

            Per default set to 5.64 as used by the German Weather
            Service radars.
    hydrophobicity : float
        Empirical parameter based on the hydrophobicity of the radome
        material.

            - 0.165 for standard radomes,
            - 0.0575 for hydrophobic radomes.

            Per default set to 0.165.
    n_r : int
        The radius of rangebins within the rain-intensity is
        statistically evaluated as the representative rain-intensity
        over radome.
    stat : object
        A name of a numpy function for statistical aggregation of the
        central rangebins defined by n_r.
