**To anyone who wants to use a bleeding edge version of wradlib from this repository:**

wradlib uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for Continuous Integration. This means that once new code is pushed to the wradlib repository, Travis runs a suite of tests. In case the tests run without failure, a new documentation will be built and pushed to the [wradlib documentation website](http://wradlib.github.io/wradlib-docs).

Below you see the Travis Status of wradlib. A red status indicates that the current revision of wradlib did not pass the tests successfully. You should be aware of that. then again, you should be aware that a green Travis status is not a guarantee that the latest revision is bug free. It just means that our tests did not find any bugs.
