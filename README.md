**To anyone who wants to use a bleeding edge version of wradlib from this repository:**

wradlib uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for Continuous Integration. This means that once new code is pushed to the wradlib repository, Travis runs a suite of tests. In case the tests run without failure, a new documentation will be built on readthedocs and is available at the [wradlib documentation website](https://docs.wradlib.org).

Below you see the Travis Status of wradlib. A red status indicates that the current revision of wradlib did not pass the tests successfully. You should be aware of that. then again, you should be aware that a green Travis status is not a guarantee that the latest revision is bug free. It just means that our tests did not find any bugs. Also the status of code coverage, of ReadTheDocs documentation builds and of Availability of wradlib conda package is displayed.
