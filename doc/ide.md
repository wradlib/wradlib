# Python IDE's

## Development Environments vs. Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks are great for courses and for interactive data exploration. However, they are not suited for developing applications. Once you start to build applications or scripts on top of
{{wradlib}}, you should use a suitable Integrated Development Environment (IDE). IDEs give you the opportunity for organising different source files, debugging, available inspection and a lot more.


## Some suitable IDEs

There is a [comprehensive Wiki article on Python IDE's](https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments). Maybe a bit too comprehensive... if you already are used to an IDE and happy with it, there is no reason to change it.

However, if you have no idea which IDE to choose, why not start with [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org)? It can be installed into conda environments, in some cases it is installed by default. If you've installed Spyder, just open a shell and enter:

```bash
$ spyder
```

Alternatively, we can warmly recommend [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm) which has a free, yet powerful [Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features).
