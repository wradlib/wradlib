## Users

{{wradlib}} is intended to be a community effort, and community needs communication.

The key communication platform for {{wradlib}} is beside the [wradlib-repository](https://github.com/wradlib/wradlib) the [openradar-discourse](https://openradar.discourse.group/) discussion forum. Through both ways you can help to improve {{wradlib}} by reporting bugs, proposing enhancements, or by contributing code snippets (in any programming language) and documentation of algorithms.

You can also ask other users and developers for help, or use your own knowledge and experience to help other users. We strongly encourage you to join [openradar-discourse](https://openradar.discourse.group/). Check it out!

## Contributors

We need your help to enhance the capabilities of {{wradlib}}! Is there an algorithm you would consider useful? Please **provide code (in any programming language) or documentation**. We will give it a try to integrate this algorithm in {{wradlib}}.

However, **there is an even better way:** Start a [Pull Request](dev_guide.md#contributing).
