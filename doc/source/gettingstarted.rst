Getting Started
===============

.. _ref-installation:

Installation
------------

In order to run *wradlib*, you need to have a Python interpreter installed on your local computer, as well as a number of Python packages (`Dependencies`_). We recommend to install `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda/>`_ as it installs Python, a number of required packages, and other useful tools (e.g. spyder).

Using Anaconda the installation process is harmonised across platforms. Download and install the latest Anaconda distribution from https://www.continuum.io/downloads for your specific OS.
The latest distribution tested by us are **Anaconda2-2.5.0** and **Anaconda3-2.5.0** (for python2.7 and python3 respectively).

If your Anaconda Python installation is working, the following command (in a console) should work::

    $ python --version
    Python 3.5.1 :: Continuum Analytics, Inc.

Now you can use the ``conda`` package and environment manager (`conda documentation <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/index.html/>`_) to setup your *wradlib* installation.

#. Clone the root environment or create one from scratch::

    $ conda create --name wradlib --clone root
    or
    $ conda create --name wradlib python=2.7

#. Add the conda-forge channel, where wradlib and its dependencies are located. Read more about the community effort `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.github.io/>`_::

    $ conda config --add channels conda-forge

#. Activate the wradlib environment

    Linux::

        $ source activate wradlib

    Windows::

        > activate wradlib

#. Install wradlib and its dependencies::

    (wradlib) $ conda install wradlib

#. Make sure the GDAL_DATA environment variable (needed for georeferencing) is set within your environment. If not, you can set it like this:

    Linux/OSX::

        (wradlib) $ export GDAL_DATA=/path/to/anaconda/envs/wradlib/share/gdal

    Windows CMD.exe::

        [wradlib] > setx GDAL_DATA C:\path\to\anaconda\envs\wradlib\Library\share\gdal

Now you have a ``conda`` environment with a working *wradlib* installation.

Test the integrity of your wradlib installation by opening a console window and typing calling the python interpreter::

    $ python
    Python 3.5.1 |Continuum Analytics, Inc.| (default, Dec  7 2015, 11:16:01)
    [GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-1)] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

The Python prompt should appear. Then type::

    >>> import wradlib
    >>> wradlib.__version__
    '0.8.0'

If everything is ok, this will show the running wradlib version. If the *wradlib* package is not found by the interpreter, you will get::

    >>> import wradlib
    ImportError: No module named wradlib

Alternatively, you can install the `Bleeding edge code`_, but you have to keep track of wradlibs dependencies yourself.


Bleeding edge code
------------------

.. warning:: The wradlib version on `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wradlib>`_ might lag behind the actual developments. You can use the bleeding edge code from the `wradlib repository <https://github.com/wradlib/wradlib>`_. Note, however, that you need to make sure yourself that all `Dependencies`_ are met (see below).

`Download <https://github.com/wradlib/wradlib/archive/master.zip>`_ the source, unzip, and run::

    $ python setup.py install

Alternatively, you can add the wradlib directory to your environment variable ``PYTHONPATH``.


Installing via easy_install
---------------------------

Although we recommend using the Anaconda Python Environment you can install wradlib from PyPi via easy_install.

Open a terminal and run::

    $ easy_install wradlib

Depending on your system you might need to be root (or sudo the above command) for this to work.
easy_install will then fetch the source distribution from the Python Package Index and run the installation.

Afterwards it will check for any dependencies not met, yet.

Be aware that with easy_install we can only look for python-module dependencies.
For example the numpy module itself depends on some other libraries, which need to be present in order for the module to compile properly after being downloaded by easy_install. We have no control over these dependencies and it is rather hard to give a complete overview.

Therefore we recommend trying to satisfy the dependencies using your favorite package management system.

Dependencies
------------

*wradlib* was not designed to be a self-contained library. Besides extensive use of Numpy and Scipy, *wradlib* uses additional libraries, which you will need to install before you can use *wradlib*.

.. tabularcolumns:: |L|L|L|]

+------------+-----------+-------------+
| Package    |    min    | recommended |
+============+===========+=============+
| numpy      | >= 1.6.1  | >= 1.10.1   |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| matplotlib | >= 1.1.0  | >= 1.5.1    |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| scipy      | >= 0.9    | >= 0.17.0   |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| h5py       | >= 2.0.1  | >= 2.5.0    |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| netCDF4    | >= 1.0    | >= 1.2.2    |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| gdal       | >= 1.9    | >= 2.0.2    |
+------------+-----------+-------------+

You can check whether the required `Dependencies`_ are available on your computer by opening a Python console and enter:

>>> import <package_name>
ImportError: No module named <package_name>
 
This will be the response in case the package is not available. 

In case the import is successful, you should also check the version number:

>>> package_name.__version__
some version number

The version number should be consistent with the above `Dependencies`_.


Optional Dependencies
---------------------

Apart from the obligatory `Dependencies`_, some dependencies in wradlib are optional. This is because the installation of these dependencies can be somewhat tedious while many wradlib users will not need them anyway. In case users use a wradlib function that requires an optional dependency, and this dependency is not satisfied in the local environment, wradlib will raise an exception.

As for now, the following dependencies are defined as optional:

**The speedup module**

The speedup module is intended as a collection of Fortran code in order to speed up specific wradlib function that are critical for performance.
In order to build the speedup module as a shared library, you need to use f2py (https://sysbio.ioc.ee/projects/f2py2e/). f2py usually ships with numpy and should be available via the command line. To test whether f2py is available on your system, execute ``f2py`` on the system console. Or, alternatively, ``f2py.py``. If it is available, you should get a bunch of help instructions. Now change to the wradlib module directory and execute on the system console::

    $ f2py.py -c -m speedup speedup.f

Now the speedup module should be available.

**xmltodict**

We use xmltodict to convert the Rainbow Data Files (which have an metadata XML header) to an ordered dict. It is easily installed with `pip`::

    $ pip install xmltodict


.. _ref-knownissues:

Known Issues
------------

Depending on your OS and installation method you may encounter different problems. Here are some guidelines for attacking them.

Generally it is a good idea to use your systems package manager to install dependencies. This will also take account for other needed bindings, libs etc. Windows user should install one of the (scientific) python packages to resolve the problems there.

We recommend using the Anaconda conda package and environment manager (see `Installation`_).
