How to contribute to :math:`\omega radlib`?
-----------------------------

We need your help to enhance the capabilities of :math:`\omega radlib`! Is there an algorithm you would consider useful? Please **provide code (in any programming language) or documentation**. We will it a try to integrate this algorithm in :math:`\omega radlib`.

However, **there is an even better way:** Start a `Pull Request <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/>`_!

    * **Step 1:** `Fork <https://github.com/wradlib/wradlib>`_ your own :math:`\omega radlib` repository from the :math:`\omega radlib` `main repo <https://github.com/wradlib/wradlib>`_.
    * **Step 2:** Implement your changes into the forked repository. Test your code.
    * **Step 3:** Now you want to feed these changes back into the main :math:`\omega radlib` development branch? Start a `Pull Request <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request>`_!
    * **Step 4:** We will review your changes. On approval, we will merge your fork back into the main :math:`\omega radlib` branch.
    * **Step 5:** Now everyone can benefit from your improvements.

A step-by-step tutorial for a pull request can be found `here <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>`_.

Finally, you are welcome to **contribute examples of your own** :math:`\boldsymbol \omega radlib` **applications** in our :doc:`recipes <recipes>` section. There, you will also find a guide on how to submit your recipes to the :math:`\omega radlib` documentation pages.
