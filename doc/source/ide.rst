Integrated Development Environments for Python
==============================================

Development Environments vs. Notebooks
--------------------------------------

Jupyter notebooks are great for courses and for interactive data exploration. However, they are not suited fopr developing applications. Once you start to build applications or scripts on top of :math:`\omega radlib`, you should use a suitable Integrated Development Environmemt (IDE). IDEs give you the opportunity for organising different source files, debugging, avraible inspection and a lot more. 


Some suitable IDEs
------------------

There is a [comprehensive Wiki article on Python IDEs](https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments). Maybe a bit too comprehensive... if you already are used to an IDE and happy with it, there is no reason to change it.

However, if you have no idea which IDE to choose, why not start with [Spyder](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/). It is included in the `Anaconda Python Distribution <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ by default. If you instaled Anaconda, just open a console or bash and hit::

	$ spyder
	
Alternatively, we can warmly recommend `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_ which has a free, yet powerful `Community Edition <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/>`_.
