abstract="Abstract An equation for the rate of rainfall at a given range from the radar is derived. This is expressed in terms of the power level of the received signal (corrected for attenuation by intervening cloud and atmospheric gases) and takes account of radar attenuation due to intervening rain. The equation includes a constant which measures the performance of the radar and is determined by direct calibration. At attenuating wavelengths (at 3 cm; to some extent at 5.6 cm) a small error in the calibration constant causes a large error in the measured rainfall. This error, which varies with range and may thus cause serious distortion, is, in fact, liable to be more serious than that caused if the attenuation were neglected entirely. Correcting for attenuation is therefore not recommended, unless the calibration error may be held within extremely narrow limits. Very small calibration errors may be achieved by calibrating the radar by means of a rain gauge located at a point where the attenuation is appreciable. At points of smaller attenuation, a satisfactory degree of accuracy in the calculated rate of rainfall then results. At wavelengths such as 10 cm, where the attenuation is negligible, errors in the constant still affect the measured rain, but neither so seriously, nor in a manner involving the range, thus causing no distortion. An examination of the relative importance of the attenuation by gases and cloud at three wavelengths similarly emphasizes the difficulties associated with quantitative work at the shorter wavelengths.",

Its main advantages are that it is easy to implement (both for polar and Cartesian data) and can be applied a posteriori after any other method of clutter removal has been applied. The performances of the technique during clear-sky and rainy conditions are analyzed for a 180{$\times$}150 km2 complex-orography region, using data from a non-Doppler and a Doppler radar (for both, approximately 50\% of the clear-sky clutter shows average reflectivity greater than 13 dBZ). In the case of the non-Doppler data, the texture-based code is used after a prestored static map: it is absolutely necessary and leads to excellent results. In the case of the Doppler data, the technique can be applied with satisfactory results, even after a recent approach, which, in addition to a Doppler velocity test, combine all the available information concerning radar echoes}

abstract="AbstractRadar-rainfall estimation is a complex process that involves several error sources, some of which are related to the environmental context. The presence of orographic obstacles heavily affects the quality of the retrieved radar products. In relatively flat terrain conditions, dual-polarization capability has been proven either to increase the data quality or to improve the rainfall estimate. The potential benefit of using polarimetric techniques for precipitation retrieval is evaluated here using data coming from two radar systems operating in Italy under complex-orography conditions. The analysis outlines encouraging results that might open new scenarios for operational applications. Indeed, the applied rainfall algorithm employing specific differential phase mostly outperformed the examined reflectivity-based retrieval techniques except for the analyzed winter storm. In the latter case, the likely contamination by frozen or melting snow tended to degrade the performance of the examined
Kdp-based rainfall algorithms.",

Estimation of the specific differential phase requires computing the derivative of range profiles of the differential propagation phase. The existence of possible phase wrapping, noise, and associated fluctuation in the differential propagation phase makes the evaluation of derivatives an unstable numerical process. In this paper, a robust algorithm is presented to estimate the specific differential phase, which is able to work on wrapped phases and keep up with the spatial gradients of rainfall, to provide a high-resolution specific differential phase.",

abstract="Abstract A propagation correction algorithm utilizing the differential propagation phase (?dp) was developed and tested on C-band polarimetric radar observations of tropical convection obtained during the Maritime Continent Thunderstorm Experiment. An empirical procedure was refined to estimate the mean coefficient of proportionality a (b) in the linear relationship between ?dp and the horizontal (differential) attenuation throughout each radar volume. The empirical estimates of these coefficients were a factor of 1.5?2 times larger than predicted by prior scattering simulations. This discrepancy was attributed to the routine presence of large drops [e.g., differential reflectivity Zdr {\^a}?{\textyen} 3 dB] within the tropical convection that were not included in prior theoretical studies. Scattering simulations demonstrated that the coefficients a and b are nearly constant for small to moderate sized drops (e.g., 0.5 {\^a}?{\texteuro} Zdr {\^a}?{\texteuro} 2 dB; 1 {\^a}?{\texteuro} diameter D0 <
2.5 mm) but actually increase with the differential reflectivity for drop size distributions characterized by Zdr > 2 dB. As a result, large drops 1) bias the mean coefficients upward and 2) increase the standard error associated with the mean empirical coefficients down range of convective cores that contain large drops. To reduce this error, the authors implemented a ?large drop correction? that utilizes enhanced coefficients a* and b* in large drop cores. Validation of the propagation correction algorithm was accomplished with cumulative rain gauge data and internal consistency among the polarimetric variables. The bias and standard error of the cumulative radar rainfall estimator R(Zh) [R(Kdp,Zdr)], where Zh is horizontal reflectivity and Kdp is specific differential phase, were substantially reduced after the application of the attenuation (differential attenuation) correction procedure utilizing ?dp. Similarly, scatterplots of uncorrected Zh (Zdr) versus Kdp substantially underestimated theoretical
expectations. After application of the propagation correction algorithm, the bias present in observations of both Zh(Kdp) and Zdr(Kdp) was removed and the standard errors relative to scattering simulation results were significantly reduced.",

The capability of the KOUN radar to estimate rainfall is tested on a large dataset representing different seasons and different types of rain. A dense gauge network?the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Micronet?is used to validate different polarimetric algorithms for rainfall estimation. One-hour rain totals are estimated from the KOUN radar using conventional and polarimetric algorithms and are compared with hourly accumulations measured by the gauges. Both point and areal rain estimates are examined. A new ?synthetic? rainfall algorithm has been developed for rainfall estimation. The use of the synthetic polarimetric algorithm results in significant reduction in the rms errors of hourly rain estimates when compared with the conventional
nonpolarimetric relation: 1.7 times for point measurements and 3.7 times for areal rainfall measurements.",
