The notebooks in this section will give you a glimpse of the Python language and important scientific packages, confront you with some Python exercises, and refer you to further online material. In addition, we will address some issues that are relevant to $\\omega radlib$, but do not necessarily address $\\omega radlib$ functionality.\n",

    "Mostly, we will assume that you have some basic knowledge about programming, e.g. from other interpreted langauages such as [R](https://www.r-project.org/) or Matlab. Otherwise, a fundamental course such as [Dive into Python](http://www.diveintopython3.net/) might help you more."
